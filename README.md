# Shooter
Simple shooter
Two ships on a blank background that will shoot at each
other. Each will be controlled over the internet. 

3/31/18
Tonight I went over the files to recall how everything worked. 
The second ship has to be recoded so that it can respawn on the opposite
side of the screen when going through the top, bottom, left, or right. 
Collsion detection is still necessary. Shooting is still necessary for both ships

I still have to implement the threads to allow the ships to behave on their 
own respective threads as opposed to both working off the main thread. 

I will be using UDP to control threads over the internet.

Last night I added an api that will allow me to use my Xbox 360 controller.
There have been several other changes that has happened through the months.
I still have to implement the RMI (Remote Method Invocation) to allow players
to compete online. I don't think multithreading is necessary. Once I have 
more than one player going, I will be able to see.

Uploaded files from updates that were made on
8/25/18. I have a few ideas for the keyboard or
controller option.

I started making a Bootstrapper file to as a starting point
to get the game going. I just uploaded the new files and modifications.

11/20/18
Still working with the Bootstrapper, I think I'm going to have to rewrite
the code to start at the Bootstrapper and pass desired start code to the 
Shooter1.java class.

Tonight I worked on the BootStrapper file. I'm going to have 
to learn how to use the layouts. If an image is completed on my
computer, it may not fit on another computer.

I copied image files to Shooter. This will allow me to export the file. 
So far it's not working.

I was able to resize the back ground image for varying screen sizes

Today and last night I worked on the BootStrapper. I added some text 
to show what was the intention of the game. My friend Wayne has reluctantly
agreed to help me test the prototypes. I uploaded the first executable jar 
to a google drive. The link is available on my resume. This week and next week
I will be working on Remote Method Invocation (RMI). I still have to work on 
animation. Merry Christmas.

Adjusted range on thumbstick controllers. Nothing else.

2/1/2019
Improved on the timing of the Bootstrapper. The timing between appearing text is
now uniform and enough time is given to read the text. I am still struggling 
with getting the images to appear with resizing the JFrame. I also need to 
get in contact with graphic artist for sprites for animation.
