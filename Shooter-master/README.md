# Shooter
Simple shooter
Two ships on a blank background that will shoot at each
other. Each will be controlled over the internet.

Tonight I went over the files to recall how everything worked. 
The second ship has to be recoded so that it can respawn on the opposite
side of the screen when going through the top, bottom, left, or right. 
Collsion detection is still necessary. Shooting is still necessary for both ships

I still have to implement the threads to allow the ships to behave on their 
own respective threads as opposed to both working off the main thread. 

I will be using UDP to control threads over the internet.
